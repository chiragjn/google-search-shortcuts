Google Search Shortcuts
---

An extremely stripped down bare bones re-implementation of (now broken) [google-shortcut-extension](https://github.com/monikkinom/google-shortcut-extension)

Adds keyboard's number row as shortcuts for search results on google

Hitting 1 will open the first result, 2 will open the second result, ... you get the idea.

Seems to work fine on Chrome 83+ - circa Aug 2020
Feel free to report any issues.
